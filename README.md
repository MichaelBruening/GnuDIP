GnuDIP ELGG V1.8 Plugin to integrate a GnuDIP dynamic DNS service

This plugin integrates a GnuDIP-based dynamic DNS service into your ELGG site.
The idea is to not have a free registration setup for the world, but for the members
of a GnuDIP-group where membership needs to be approved.

At the moment only one dynamic domain can be managed, the name can be saved by
the administrator along with the GnuDIP-Server, the Webfrontend-URL and the configuration
for the administrative commands to be executed via SSH.

Users are encouraged to use a password different from the one in use with ELGG and
they have to login into the integrated webfrontend separately. There they can access
the GnuDIP online documentation and download clients for automated dynDNS updates.
